          The best way to reach out to me is via email: <a href="mailto:contact@emozley.com">contact@emozley.com</a>.
          Any professional enquiries should be sent to this address rather than through other contact mediums.
          <br /> Please no spam :(

          You can also see some of my social media accounts linked in the header/navbar. There is, however, no guarantee
          that I will read or respond to messages sent on social media.
