          Hi, my name&apos;s Eleanor &ndash; I&apos;m from North London and predominately interested in law, psychology,
          business and operations, politics, railways, engineering, electronics, technology, and programming. I

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Since a very young age, I&apos;ve always been fascinated with areas connected to electronics and technology.
          This curiosity manifested itself in a strong interest in computing; as a kid, I would often play with (and
          break ðŸ˜…) various computers and laptops around.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2013, I discovered the online gaming platform <i>Roblox</i>, which allowed players to create their own
          video games, and also enabled them to write Lua code to enrich these games. I would later use PHP and MySQL to
          create websites with various functions and very questionable security, and also use Java to create Minecraft
          mods and plugins.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reaching my teenage years, I learned of Node - which allowed you to run JavaScript code outside the browser -
          and Express.js, which made it possible to build web servers and sites with Node. I fell in love with Node and
          Express instantly and they&apos;re both tools I use extensively to this day. As a teen, I would build websites
          using Node, MongoDB, and EJS, this was also the time I discovered Bootstrap and frontend frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dabbling around with frontend frameworks, I initially used Vue and Nuxt.js on the recommendation of a friend
          and greatly enjoyed the simplicity of the framework. But disappointed with how powerless Vue was, I began to
          learn Angular, although never used it in a project. I would later start using React and Next.js, both powerful
          tools I continue to use and love.
